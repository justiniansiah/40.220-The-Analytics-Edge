# A few comments about the data:
# The sentiment takes value 1, 2, 4, and 5, where 1 = very negative, 
# 2 = slightly negative, 4 = slightly positive, and 5 = very positive.
# The tweets were classified by the contributors.
# The data come from https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/
# CrowdFlower is a crowdsourcing data management company which allows users 
# to access online workforce of million of people to clean, label, and enrich data.

# Let's take a look at the negative and very negative tweets
twitter$Neg <- as.factor(twitter$sentiment<=2)

# 1889   775

######## 1. Pre-processing

# Load the text mining package
if(!require(tm)){
  install.packages("tm")
  library(tm)
}
# Note that this is a development package, so there could be some variations based on the system you run
# (e.g., different R versions or different operating systems).

# A corpus represents a collection of documents (tweets, in our case)
?Corpus
# The VectorSource helps interpret each element of the twitter$tweet object as a document,
# while the Corpus command helps represent it as a corpus.
?VectorSource
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(twitter$tweet))
corpus
# <<SimpleCorpus>>
# Metadata:  corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0
# Content:  documents: 2664
corpus[[1]]
as.character(corpus[[1]])

as.character(corpus[[2664]])

# With the function tm_map, we apply mappings (transformations) to the corpus. 
?tm_map
# There is a variety of transformations that we can apply
getTransformations()

# 1. The first goal is to convert all text to lower case (since R is case sensitive).
# Although there is a tolower transformation, it is not a part of the standard tm transformations 
# (see the output of getTransformations() in the previous section). For this reason, 
# we have to convert tolower into a transformation that can handle a corpus object properly. 
# This is done with the help of the function content_transformer.
corpus <- tm_map(corpus,content_transformer(tolower))
# Alternative command:
# corpus <- tm_map(corpus,tolower)
#
# If the command does not work, try this trick:
# (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27756693/fun-error-after-running-tolower-while-making-twitter-wordcloud)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, function(x) iconv(enc2utf8(x), sub = "byte"))
corpus<- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(function(x)    iconv(enc2utf8(x), sub = "bytes")))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus,content_transformer(tolower))
#
# Let's now check a couple of documents
as.character(corpus[[2664]])

# 2a. Then, we move on to the stopwords.
# Here is the list of english stopwords in the tm package
stopwords("english")
# let's then remove the stopwords from the corpus
corpus <- tm_map(corpus,removeWords,stopwords("english"))
# And ... Let's check a couple of documents
as.character(corpus[[1]])
as.character(corpus[[2664]])
#
# 2b. We now remove the following words: 
# 'drive', 'driving', 'driver', 'self-driving', 'car', and 'cars'.
# The reason is that many tweets contain these words,
# which are probably not going to be a predictor of the polarity of the tweets.
corpus <- tm_map(corpus,removeWords,c("drive","driving","driver","self-driving","car","cars"))
# And ... Let's check a couple of documents

# 3. Remove punctuation
corpus <- tm_map(corpus,removePunctuation)
# And ... Let's check a couple of documents
as.character(corpus[[1]])
as.character(corpus[[2664]])

# 4. Finally, we stem the words using Porter's stemming algorithm. 
# Note that you may need to load the SnowballC package to use this functionality
# (R interface to the C libstemmer library that implements Porter's word stemming algorithm).

# 5. We can now create a document-term matrix from the original corpus. 
# In particular, we have 2664 documents (rows) and 5834 terms (columns). 
# Out of the 2664*5834 terms, 23879 terms are nonzero while the remaining ones are zero.
# So, sparisty is close to 100%.

# We can do this for any documnet, such as no. 2664

# 6. An important information we can get is the frequency with which terms appear
?findFreqTerms
# With this function, we find term appearing with frequency lower than 50%
findFreqTerms(dtm,lowfreq=50)
# We can also check the frequency of specific words
dtm[,"accid"]
dtm[,"awesom"]
# This part of the analysis is aimed to remove terms that do not appear frequently
?removeSparseTerms
# In this specific case, we remove all terms with at least 99.5% empty entries
