1. In this exercise, you will study a technique called latent semantic indexing, which applies singular value decomposition to create a low dimensional representation of data that is designed to capture semantic similarity of words. 
A list of all 460 unique words/terms that occurs in a set of 9 documents is provided in lsiWords.txt. 
A document by term matrix is in lsiMatrix.txt.

(a) Use the read.table() function to read in the data from the lsiMatrix.txt file. 

Create a matrix X that is the transpose of the lsiMatrix, so that each column represents a document. 
```{r}
setwd("D:/School Stuff/40 .220 The Analytics Edge/W11/0) Prac")
lsiMatrix <- read.table("lsiMatrix.txt")
X <- as.matrix(t(lsiMatrix))

```

- Compute the singular value decomposition of X and make an approximation to it using the first 2 singular values and vectors. 
```{r}
s <- svd(X)

X_hat = s$u[,1:2] %*% diag(s$d[1:2]) %*% t(s$v[,1:2])
```

- Plot the low dimensional representation of the 9 documents in two dimensions by using the right singular vectors. 
```{r}
plot(s$v[,1],s$v[,2])
text(s$v[,1],s$v[,2],c(1:9),adj=2)
```

- Which two documents appear to be the closest to each other in this low dimensional representation?
7 and 8 are the closest




(b) Consider finding documents that are about alien abductions. 
If you look at the words in lsiWords.txt, there are three versions of this word, 
term 23 ("abducted"), terms 24 ("abduction"), term 25 ("abductions"). 
Suppose you want to find documents containing the word "abducted", documents 2 and 3 contain it but document 1 does not. In the original dataset however document 1 is also related to the topic. Thus LSI should also find document 1. 


- Create a test document q containing the one word "abducted" and project it into the 2D subspace to make q_hat. 
```{r}
str(X) # to see rows in X which is 460
q <- matrix(0,nrow = 460, ncol= 1)
q[23] <- 1 #term 23
qhat <- solve(diag(s$d[1:2])) %*% t(s$u[,1:2]) %*% q
str(qhat)
```

- Now compute the cosine similarity between q_hat and the low dimensional representation of all the documents. 
```{r}
cosine <- matrix(0,9,1)
for (i in 1:9){
  cosine[i] <- sum(qhat*s$v[i,1:2])/sqrt(sum(qhat^2)*sum(s$v[i,1:2]^2))
}
order(cosine,decreasing = T)

```

- What are the top 3 closest matches?
1,3,2

Question 2

2. The data in the file mroz.csv includes data on hours worked for 753 married women. 
The variables in the dataset include:
 hours: Hours worked
 kidslt6: Number of children less than six years old
 kidsge6 Number of kids between 6 and 18 years of age
 age: Age
 educ: Years of education
 exper: Past years of labor market experience
 nwifeinc: Husband's earnings, measured in thousands of dollars

(a) Quadratic functions are often used in labor economics to capture increasing or decreasing marginal rates. 
- Start by defining a new variables exper2 which is defined as the square of the exper variable.

```{r}
mroz <- read.csv("mroz.csv")
mroz$exper2 <- (mroz$exper)^2
```

- Run a linear regression on the hours worked using all the variables including exper2 and report on the R-squared and adjusted R-squared. 
- Write down the fitted equation. 

```{r}
mrozmodel <- lm(data= mroz, hours~.)
summary(mrozmodel)


```
Multiple R-squared:  0.2656,	Adjusted R-squared: 0.2587 
hours =  1330.4824 + -442.0899*kidslt6 + -32.7792*kidsge6 + -30.5116*age + 28.7611*educ + 65.6725*exper + -3.4466*nwifinc + -0.7005*exper2


- Does the result indicate that the exper2 variable is significant at the 5% level? 
> Yes

- Does the results indicate that experience has an increasing or diminishing marginal effect on wage?
> diminishing marginal effect (exper^2 is -ve)


(b) What is the range of fitted values for hours from the result in part (a)? 
- How many of the fitted values are below 0? 
- How many observations in the dataset have hours = 0? 
- How do these two numbers compare?
```{r}
summary(mrozmodel$fitted.values)
```
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 -719.8   417.5   737.7   740.6  1093.1  1614.7
The range is -719.8 to 1614.7

```{r}
table(mrozmodel$fitted.values<0)
```
FALSE  TRUE 
  714    39 
39 are below 0

```{r}
table(mroz$hours==0)
```
FALSE  TRUE 
  428   325 
325 observations are hours = 0

The observed values for hours = 0 is far larger than the fitted values for hours < 0


(c) Estimate a Tobit model to predict hours using all the variables including exper2. 
Compare the signs of the coeffcients with the results in part (a) and check if the results match?

```{r}
library(survival)
mroztobit <- survreg(Surv(hours , hours > 0, type="left") ~. , data = mroz, dist="gaussian")

summary(mroztobit)
#mroztobit_pred <- predict(mroztobit,newdata=mroz)
```
In (a) the lm was hours =  1330.4824 + -442.0899*kidslt6 + -32.7792*kidsge6 + -30.5116*age + 28.7611*educ + 65.6725*exper + -3.4466*nwifinc + -0.7005*exper2
Here the tobit model gives: hours =  965.3053 + -894.0217*kidslt6 + -16.2180*kidsge6 + -54.4050*age + 80.6456*educ + 131.5643*exper + -8.8142*nwifinc + -1.8642*exper2

The signs match the lm in (a)



(d) We will now compare the R-squared values from the results in part (a) and (c). Remember that for the linear regression model, the R-squared value is the squared correlation between the fitted values of hours and the actual value. 
We now define the R-squared for a Tobit model in a similar manner. Given the estimated values of beta and the scale parameter sigma, the predicted mean value of the dependent variable is given as:

E(y_i | x_i) = beta' * x_i * PHI(beta' * x_i/sigma) + sigma*phi(beta' * x_i/sigma)

Compute this value for all observations (remember that the predict function in survreg only returns the beta'*x_i values). 
- Now define the R-squared value by computing the correlation of these predicted value with the actual value of the hours. 
- Compare the R-squared values of the two models and comment on which is preferred.

```{r}
#Multiple R-squared:  0.2656, in (a)
(cor(mrozmodel$fitted.values,mroz$hours)^2) #0.2656245
tobitpred <- predict(mroztobit,newdata = mroz)
meanval = tobitpred*pnorm(tobitpred/mroztobit$scale) + mroztobit$scale*dnorm(tobitpred/mroztobit$scale)

cor(meanval,mroz$hours)^2

```
(a) has rsquared value of 0.2656245
while tobit's rsquared is 0.2742441

the tobit model has a greater rsquared value so it is preferred. 
>**However, it is to be noted that the Tobit model was not designed to maximise the R2 value (its objective is to maximise log-likelihood).**



(e) We now compare the estimates from the two models as a function of education. Assume that all the variables other than educ are set at their mean values. 
- Write down the linear equation that describes the average hours worked as a function of the education level from the linear regression model

In (a) the lm was hours =  1330.4824 + -442.0899*kidslt6 + -32.7792*kidsge6 + -30.5116*age + 28.7611*educ + 65.6725*exper + -3.4466*nwifinc + -0.7005*exper2
```{r}
coeff <- mrozmodel$coefficients[1] + mrozmodel$coefficients[2]*mean(mroz$kidslt6) + mrozmodel$coefficients[3]*mean(mroz$kidsge6) + mrozmodel$coefficients[4]*mean(mroz$age) + mrozmodel$coefficients[6]*mean(mroz$exper) + mrozmodel$coefficients[7]*mean(mroz$nwifeinc) +
mrozmodel$coefficients[8]*mean(mroz$exper2)
coeff
```
E(hours) = 387.1927 + 28.7611*educ


- What is the estimated value at 8 and 12 years of education from the linear regression model?

```{r}
coeff + mrozmodel$coefficients[5]*8
coeff + mrozmodel$coefficients[5]*12
```
(Intercept) 
   617.2817 
(Intercept) 
   732.3262 

- Compare this with the estimated values from the Tobit model. 
- Is there increasing or decreasing marginal effect of education on the hours worked in the Tobit model?
```{r}
coeff2 <- mroztobit$coefficients[1] + mroztobit$coefficients[2]*mean(mroz$kidslt6) + mroztobit$coefficients[3]*mean(mroz$kidsge6) + mroztobit$coefficients[4]*mean(mroz$age) + mroztobit$coefficients[6]*mean(mroz$exper) + mroztobit$coefficients[7]*mean(mroz$nwifeinc) +
mroztobit$coefficients[8]*mean(mroz$exper2)

pred8 <- coeff2 + mroztobit$coefficients[5]*8
pred12 <- coeff2 + mroztobit$coefficients[5]*12

pred8*pnorm(pred8/mroztobit$scale) + mroztobit$scale*dnorm(pred8/mroztobit$scale)
pred12*pnorm(pred12/mroztobit$scale) + mroztobit$scale*dnorm(pred12/mroztobit$scale)
```

(Intercept) 
   423.5725 
(Intercept) 
   597.6833 
   
The values from Tobit gives lower estimates of expected hours worked for these levels of education. The marginal effects are also increasing from education, on the hours worked.
>Note that the difference bewteen the Tobit estimates is larger than that of the linear estimate.
